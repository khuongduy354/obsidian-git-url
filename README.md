# Obsidian Git Url Plugin
### File's remote repo url  
I find it inconvinient to access obsidian files from other devices, especially the ones without Obsidian installed. 
So I leverate [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), and use gitlab as the remote storage.
So accessing https://gitlab.com/username/obsidian-repo/-/blob/master/filename.md, open the file directly on browser. 
This plugin is very simple, it just takes the remote repo url + file_path and add it to your clipboard.

### Usage   
- In settings, set the base url of your repo (e.g above: https://gitlab.com/username/obsidian-repo/-/blob/master/)
- Open file explorer tab in obsdian -> right click on file -> Copy git path 
- That's it, now paste the link to browser and access the file
